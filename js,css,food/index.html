        Kitchen is a special place in our home, usually with positive associations. This is where family ties and friendship grow. This is where our children learn about the secrets of preparing meals that they will later pass on to their successors. However, the 21st century is governed by its own laws. The food industry has caught our palate, making us more and more likely to reach for ready-to-eat dishes that are enough to put in the microwave. And these extremely comfortable products ruin our health.</div>

        Fast Slow Food - What does this mean? This is a bunch of words from two seemingly mutually exclusive trends. I decided to choose from both of the best. Fast Food - Fast food, usually bought ready or in semi-finished form, quick to prepare, usually poor quality, consumed by children / young / older and overworked / lazy people. Junk food and junk eating. Slow Food is a global movement promoting traditional, regional and healthy cuisine. For me Slow Food is also the way we look at food: good quality products, local and seasonal products, traditional production methods, food for pleasure, meal celebration, nice time with loved ones. Fast Slow Food is an attempt to reconcile the fast-paced, urban life with the idea of ​​conscious enjoyment of the culinary world. Good and inexpensive products, fast recipes, and finally a good time.</div>
